# Twitch Bot

This code uses the java.net.Socket class to connect to the Twitch IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server and send and receive messages.

To use this code, you will need to replace USERNAME and TOKEN with your Twitch username and token, respectively. You can get your token by following the instructions in the Twitch Developer Portal. You will also need to replace YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME_HERE with the name of the channel you want to join.

I'm pretty sure Twitch developers have a version in Python lol
